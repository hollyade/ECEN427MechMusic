Your groupâ€™s task is to develop, test, demonstrate, and document two new mechatronic chordophone mechanisms:
a string picker and a string damper.  
Picker must be capable of actuating the string to achieve at least an XX dB increase in amplitude between the at-rest state and the picked state.  
The damper should be demonstrably able to, at minimum, return the string from its picked state (0.25 seconds after string picking) to its at-rest state within 0.25 second of contact with the string.  
Examine different guitar picks and use suitable music information retrieval techniques to detail these differences.  
Examine different damper materials and use suitable music information retrieval techniques to detail these differences.  
A key consideration in any musical mechatronic mechanism is acoustic noise emission.   
Acoustic noise emission must be characterisred using suitable music information retrieval techniques and have taken steps to address it.  
Picker and damper should be demonstrably able to pick and damp at a rate of at least 120 picks/damps per minute.
